# Adanomad Resume Analyzer Challenge

I wrote the frontend page on the GitHub .NET Codespace.

This repo originally built a Weather API using Minimal APIs, opens Swagger so you can call and test the API, and displays the data in a web application using Blazor with .NET 8.

I directly edited the frontend razor page to accomplish resume analysis.

## Overview

This app takes in resume information, and generates both a word cloud of the most frequently mentioned words and the top 5 most frequently mentioned technical skills.
