# Adanomad Resume Analyzer Challenge

I wrote the frontend page on the GitHub .NET Codespace.

This repo originally built a Weather API using Minimal APIs, opens Swagger so you can call and test the API, and displays the data in a web application using Blazor with .NET 8.

I directly edited the frontend razor page to accomplish resume analysis.

## Overview

This app takes in resume information, and generates both a word cloud of the most frequently mentioned words and the top 5 most frequently mentioned technical skills.

### Run Options

Go to Code -> CodeSpaces and click on 'Create codespace on main' to open in the browser.

## Getting started

1. **üì§ One-click setup**: opening the CodeSpace gives you a fully configured cloud developer environment.
2. **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run all, one-click again**: Use VS Code's built-in *Run* command and open the forwarded ports *8080* and *8081* in your browser.

3. If it doesn't open automatically, go to ports and click on the globe to open the front end.
